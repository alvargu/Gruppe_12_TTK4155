# Term Project - Embedded and Industrial Computer Systems Design (TTK4155)

This repo contains code for the (in)famous "Bygger'n" term project in TTK4155 at NTNU, autumn semester of the 2024/25 academic year.

The project is based around an Atmega162 MCU and an Arduino Due. The two MCUs, plus an assortment of peripherals, constitue an embedded system that controls an electro-mechanical ping pong game.

The project is written entirely in C, and the physical system is wired on breadboards.
